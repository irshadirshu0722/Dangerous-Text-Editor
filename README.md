Live Text Input: Start typing your text in the editor just like any regular text editor. The moment you begin, the editor springs to life, ready to respond to your every keystroke.

Text Fade-Out: The editor has a devious trick up its sleeve. If you pause typing for 5 seconds, it will slowly start fading out your text. The longer you pause, the more your text fades into the background.

Text Disappears: If you push the boundaries of procrastination and pause typing for a full 10 seconds, your text will vanish entirely, leaving you with a blank slate.

Restart Button: Don't worry; there's a way to recover your lost text and restart the fun. Once your text has disappeared, a "Restart" button magically appears. Click it to reset the editor and start anew.
